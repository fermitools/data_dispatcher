.. _SearchQL:

Searching Projects by Metadata
==============================

Each Data Dispatcher project has the following attributes:

    * owner - string - username of the user who created the project
    * state - string - current state of the project. Can be ``active``, ``abandoned``, ``cancelled``, ``done``, ``failed``
    * created - datetime - date/time when the project was created
    * id - integer - project id
    * query - string - MetaCat query used to select files for the project

In addition, a project may have an arbitrary dictionary with user-defined project metadata. For example:

   .. code-block::
   
       {
           "reco-version": "1.23.7",
           "mode": "debug",
           "events_per_file": 1024,
           "MaxE": 3.14
       }

Data Dispatcher does not use project metadata in any way except passing it as is to the worker, when asked for the next file to process
for the project.
Therefore, project metadata can be any JSON dictionary. 
There are no restrictions on the project metadata field names or complexity of the project metadata dictionary.

Data Dispatcher provides a way to search projects by their attributes and metadata.

Project Search Queries
----------------------

The user can query Data Dispatcher for projects writing the query in a subset of MQL. Project query is a logical expression,
built from operations on project attributes and metadata fields. If an attribute name appears in a query, it is assumed to
be referring to the project attribute, not the project metadata.

Project query is a logical combination of primitive operations expressed in terms of constants, project attributes and metadata fields.
If metadata includes a field with the same name as a project attribute (e.g. "created" or "owner"), the query always uses the
value of the named project attribute and not the metadata field.

When the query is executed the combined logical expression is evaluated for each project and then those projects, for which the
expression is evaluated to ``true`` are returned as the query result.

Expressions
-----------

The following primitive operations are supported:

    * <field> present                                           -- checks if the field is present in the project metadata
    * <field> (< | = | > | >= | <= | !=) <value>                -- comparison
    * <field> ~ "<regular expression>"                          -- string matching
    * <field> in ( <constant>,<constant>,... )                  -- enumerated set of values 
    * <field> in <constant>:<constant>                          -- range of values
    * <constant> in <field>                                     -- if the <field> is an array, checks if the <constant> is in the array
    * "<constant>" in <field>                                   -- if the <field> is a string, checks if the "<constant>" a substring
    
The query language also supports ``not`` variations of some operations:

    * <field> not in ( <constant>,<constant>,... )
    * <field> not in <constant>:<constant>
    * <constant> not in <field>
    * <field> not present                                      

For array metadata fields, the language supports indexing:

    * <field>[<index>] (< | = | > | >= | <= | !=) <value>              
    * <field>[<index>] ~ "<regular expression>"                     
    * <field>[<index>] in ( <constant>,<constant>,... )             
    * <field>[<index>] in <constant>:<constant>                   
    * <constant> in <field>[<index>]                              
    * "<constant>" in <field>[<index>]                            
    
Here, ``index`` can be one of:
    
    * integer - for arrays
    * string - for dictionaries
    * ``any``
    * ``all``
    
Keywords ``any`` and ``all`` can be used with dictionaries and arrays to apply the operation to any or all collection members. For example:

    .. code-block::

        events[any] = 32768
        events[all] in (32174, 32128)
        bits[any] = "on"
    
Atomic operations can be combined into more complex expressions using Boolean algebra:

    .. code-block::
    
        state=active and ! (version >= "1.23" and bits[any] = "on")

Constants
---------
The project query constant can be of one of the following data types:

    * Integers
    * Floating point constants
    * Strings
    * Boolean values (``true``, ``false``)
    * ``null``

String constants are enclosed in double or single quotes. But "safe" string constants 
(string, which consist only of letters, digits and ``%$@_^.%*?-``) do not need to be enclosed in quotes.
If possible an unquoted string will be interpreted as an integer or a floating point number.
If you need such a string to remain a string, it needs to be enclosed in quotes.

Unquoted strings ``null``, ``true`` and ``false`` are treated as null and boolean constants.

The project creation datetime attribute `created` is a date-time field. To enter its value in the query, use string in the format:

    .. code-block::
    
        "YYYY-MM-DD[ HH:MM:SS[+/-HH:MM]]"

Query Examples
--------------

    .. code-block::

        owner=johndoe and created > "2022-04-01"
    
        state = "abandoned" 
            and created < "2022-05-01 00:00:00" 
            and created >  "2022-04-01 00:00:00"

        state = failed and "dc4:dc4" in query

        query ~ "files .*from.* dune:run[A-Z][0-9]+ .*"
        
        owner in ("alice", "bob", "carl")
            and ! (
                app_version >= "1.5" and debug = true
                or app_version >= "1.4"
            )
            and state in ("active", "cancelled")
